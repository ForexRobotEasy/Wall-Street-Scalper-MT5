## Code Explanation

The code provided here is for educational purposes and showcases the basic logic of the Wall Street Scalper Expert Advisor. It is important to note that this code may require additional modifications and optimizations to work effectively in real trading conditions.

The code includes the necessary libraries for trading operations and defines global variables for user-defined parameters such as stop loss, take profit, profit ratio, and maximum number of orders.

The expert advisor's main function is the `OnTick()` function, which is executed on every tick of the market. It checks if the maximum allowed number of orders is already open and calculates the lot size based on the account balance. It also ensures that the lot size is not less than the minimum allowed by the broker.

The code then calculates the stop loss and take profit price levels based on the predefined parameters and the current market prices. It opens a new buy order and sell order using the `OrderSend()` function, specifying the lot size, stop loss, take profit, and order type.

The `OnDeinit()` function is the expert advisor's deinitialization function and is called when the expert advisor is removed from the chart or the terminal is closed. It closes all remaining open positions by iterating over all positions and using the `Close()` function.

Please note that this is a simplified explanation of the code's functionality. It is advisable to thoroughly review and test the code in a demo account before using it in a live trading environment.
